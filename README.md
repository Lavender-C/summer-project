The summer project aims to engage students in creating and deploying a web-based application within a two-month time frame. Students will work collaboratively in teams, taking on different roles and responsibilities to incrementally develop the application from start to finish, using the Agile methodology.

Throughout the project, students will gain hands-on experience in web development, enhancing their programming skills and expanding their technical knowledge. They will have the opportunity to work on frontend and/or backend development, database management, system (architecture) design, CI/CD pipelines, and also non-technical roles such as management, marketing, branding, and QA/UX. The project also focuses on fostering teamwork, collaboration, and project management skills as students work together to overcome challenges and meet project milestones.

By participating in this summer project, students will have the chance to build their portfolios and resumes with a real-world web application, showcasing their practical skills and commitment to learning ubiquitous and intricate systems. They will also benefit from networking opportunities, connecting with peers, mentors, and faculty involved in the project. Additionally, the project will provide students with exposure to industry practices and development methodologies, preparing them for future careers in related fields.

It may seem a bit overwhelming to realize what you're getting yourself into, but don't worry! You don't have to be fully committed to join. The goal of this project is to provide you with a valuable learning experience, skill development, personal growth, and the opportunity to work communally on a meaningful project that can have a lasting impact on your academic and professional journeys.
